  # Run scripts/init_backend.py once to create the S3 bucket. Fill in the
  # values below, then: terraform init -migrate-state
  #
  # use_lockfile enables S3's native state locking (conditional writes --
  # no DynamoDB table required). Requires Terraform >= 1.10.0. Replaces the
  # old S3+DynamoDB pattern: one less resource to provision, pay for, and
  # orphan on teardown.
  #
  # workspace_key_prefix makes state workspace-aware: the "default" workspace
  # (what a plain `terraform apply` uses if you never run `terraform
  # workspace`) still resolves to exactly `key` below, so this is a no-op for
  # today's single-environment usage. Running `terraform workspace new
  # staging` gets its own isolated state at
  # `environments/staging/terraform.tfstate` automatically, no key changes
  # needed by hand. See environments/dev.tfvars.example for the full
  # workflow and its current limits -- state isolation is real, resource
  # *naming* isolation (e.g. two workspaces both trying to create an EKS
  # cluster named "bookstore-eks" in the same account) is not solved by
  # this alone.
  #
  # bucket and region are intentionally left empty here -- scripts/init_backend.py
  # patches both in place with your real account's bucket name and config.env's
  # AWS_REGION before the first `terraform init`. Terraform backend blocks can't
  # reference variables at all (resolved before any variables are evaluated, a
  # real HCL limitation), so this can only ever be kept correct by exactly that
  # kind of external patch, not a `var.foo` reference.
